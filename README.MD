- Required packages: `bash`, `jq`, `bc`, `termux-api` (optional but recommended)

## üì• Installation Guide

### Step 1: Install Termux
Download and install Termux using the download button above or from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/).

### Step 2: Install Required Packages
Open Termux and run the following commands:
```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install bash jq bc termux-api -y
```

### Step 3: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/Gaming_RAM_Optimizer.git
```

### Step 4: Make the Script Executable
```bash
cd Gaming_RAM_Optimizer
chmod +x ram_optimizer.sh
```

### Step 5: First Run
```bash
./ram_optimizer.sh
```

## üìñ Usage Instructions

### Interactive Mode
Launch the full interactive interface with:
```bash
./ram_optimizer.sh
```

### Command-line Options
The script also supports command-line arguments for non-interactive use:

```bash
# Start RAM optimization
./ram_optimizer.sh --start

# Stop RAM optimization
./ram_optimizer.sh --stop

# Perform RAM boost
./ram_optimizer.sh --boost

# Display system status
./ram_optimizer.sh --status

# Activate a game profile
./ram_optimizer.sh --game codm

# Show help
./ram_optimizer.sh --help
```

## üéÆ Game Profiles

The optimizer includes specialized profiles for popular mobile games:

| Game | Package Name | Optimizations |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| **Call of Duty Mobile** | com.activision.callofduty.shooter | Priority boost, background app management |
| **Free Fire** | com.dts.freefireth, com.dts.freefiremax | Memory optimization, display settings |
| **Bloodstrike** | com.netease.bloodstrike | CPU priority, background process management |
| **Delta Force** | com.proximabeta.deltaforce | Memory allocation, process prioritization |

When a game profile is activated:
- The selected game receives processing priority
- Non-essential background apps are closed
- Display brightness is maximized
- CPU governor is set to performance mode (if available)
- Automatic memory boosting is enabled

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

The Gaming RAM Optimizer stores its configuration in a JSON file that can be modified through the interactive menu:

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "dim_brightness": true,
    "show_battery_stats": true,
    "auto_boost": true,
    "boost_interval": 300,
    "gaming_mode": false,
    "current_game_profile": "none"
  },
  "game_profiles": {
    "codm": {
      "priority_apps": ["com.activision.callofduty.shooter"],
      "kill_list": ["com.facebook.katana", "com.instagram.android"]
    },
    "free_fire": {
      "priority_apps": ["com.dts.freefireth", "com.dts.freefiremax"],
      "kill_list": ["com.facebook.katana", "com.instagram.android"]
    },
    "bloodstrike": {
      "priority_apps": ["com.netease.bloodstrike"],
      "kill_list": ["com.facebook.katana", "com.instagram.android"]
    },
    "delta_force": {
      "priority_apps": ["com.proximabeta.deltaforce"],
      "kill_list": ["com.facebook.katana", "com.instagram.android"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration Options Explained

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `dim_brightness` | Enable automatic brightness management | `true` |
| `show_battery_stats` | Show battery statistics in status | `true` |
| `auto_boost` | Enable automatic RAM boosting | `true` |
| `boost_interval` | Seconds between automatic boosts | `300` |
| `gaming_mode` | High-performance mode for gaming | `false` |
| `current_game_profile` | Currently active game profile | `none` |

## üìä How It Works

### Memory Optimization

The memory optimization process:
1. Captures current memory state
2. Flushes system caches using appropriate commands
3. Clears application caches when possible
4. Measures freed memory and reports results

### Game Optimization

When a game profile is activated:
1. Non-essential background apps are closed
2. Display brightness is optimized
3. CPU governor is adjusted (if possible)
4. Priority is given to game processes
5. Automatic memory management is configured

</div>

### Monitoring System

The monitoring system:
1. Tracks RAM usage and availability
2. Monitors CPU usage across cores
3. Measures battery level and temperature
4. Provides real-time feedback through notifications

## üîã Battery Considerations

- **Gaming Mode**: Higher brightness and performance settings will use more battery
- **Temperature Management**: The optimizer will warn you of high temperatures that could affect battery health
- **Background Optimization**: When not gaming, the optimizer can reduce brightness to save battery
- **Auto-boost**: Regularly freeing memory can help prevent battery-draining memory leaks

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"Command not found" error** | Ensure you've run `chmod +x ram_optimizer.sh` |
| **Termux API errors** | Run `pkg install termux-api` and install the Termux:API app |
| **No temperature reading** | Some devices don't expose temperature sensors to non-root apps |
| **"Failed to set CPU governor"** | Root access is required for CPU governor changes |
| **Game not optimized properly** | Check if the game package name matches in the config file |
| **Notification not showing** | Ensure Termux has notification permissions |
