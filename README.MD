## üìñ Usage Instructions

### Interactive Mode
Launch the full interactive interface with:
```bash
./ram_optimizer.sh
```

### Command Line Options
```bash
./ram_optimizer.sh --start    # Start the optimizer service in background
./ram_optimizer.sh --stop     # Stop the running optimizer service
./ram_optimizer.sh --status   # Display current system statistics
./ram_optimizer.sh --boost    # Perform immediate memory optimization
./ram_optimizer.sh --config   # View or modify configuration settings
./ram_optimizer.sh --temp     # Check current battery temperature
./ram_optimizer.sh --help     # Show complete help message
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration

Create a custom configuration file at `~/.config/ram_optimizer/config.json` with the following options:

```json
{
  "brightness_control": true,
  "min_brightness": 30,
  "max_brightness": 80,
  "temperature_warnings": true,
  "critical_temp": 42,
  "warning_temp": 39,
  "stat_refresh_rate": 5,
  "aggressive_optimization": false
}
```

### Configuration Options Explained

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `brightness_control` | Enable automatic brightness management | `true` |
| `min_brightness` | Minimum brightness level (%) | `30` |
| `max_brightness` | Maximum brightness level (%) | `80` |
| `temperature_warnings` | Enable temperature alert notifications | `true` |
| `critical_temp` | Critical temperature threshold (¬∞C) | `42` |
| `warning_temp` | Warning temperature threshold (¬∞C) | `39` |
| `stat_refresh_rate` | System stats refresh interval (seconds) | `5` |
| `aggressive_optimization` | Use more aggressive RAM clearing (may affect multitasking) | `false` |

## üìä How It Works

### System Monitoring Architecture
The RAM Optimizer continuously monitors key system metrics through Termux API calls:

1. **Data Collection Layer**
   - Gathers RAM usage statistics
   - Monitors CPU utilization across cores
   - Tracks battery level and temperature

2. **Analysis Engine**
   - Processes collected metrics
   - Detects potential performance bottlenecks
   - Identifies optimization opportunities

3. **Optimization Layer**
   - Applies memory optimization techniques
   - Manages display brightness based on usage patterns
   - Issues temperature alerts when thresholds are reached

### Memory Optimization Techniques

The memory optimization function utilizes several techniques:
- Clearing cached application data
- Releasing unused memory pages
- Optimizing background processes
- Implementing adaptive resource allocation

## üîã Battery Impact

The RAM Optimizer is designed with battery efficiency in mind:

- **Minimal Footprint**: Typically uses less than 0.5% CPU when idle
- **Smart Polling**: Adjusts monitoring frequency based on system load
- **Battery Awareness**: Reduces functionality when battery is low
- **Temperature Management**: Helps prevent overheating that can damage battery

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"Command not found" error** | Ensure you've run `chmod +x ram_optimizer.sh` |
| **Termux API errors** | Run `pkg install termux-api` and install the Termux:API app |
| **Script crashes on startup** | Check system compatibility with `uname -a` |
| **No temperature reading** | Some devices don't expose temperature sensors |
| **Brightness control not working** | Ensure display permissions are granted to Termux |

For additional help, open an issue on the GitHub repository.
